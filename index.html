      <p>My husband and I decided to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary on the beautiful island of Maui, Hawaii. 
         We wanted this vacation to be laid back and not weighed down with multiple activities and driving. 
         Our plan was to celebrate our relationship, relax, and embrace the beauty of the island and its people.</p>

      <h2>The Accomodations</h2>
      <P>We stayed at <a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/hnmmc-wailea-beach-resort-marriott-maui/rooms/">Marriott's Wailea Beach Resort</a> for 6 days and 5 nights. 
         They have many options and price points for lodging to choose from. We selected the Ocean Front King so that we could view the ocean and breathe the fresh air as much as possible.
         Each room type came with its own set of features but the most common among them were:

         <ul>

   <h2>The Experience</h2>
      <p>
         There were many activities and amenities to experience while at the Wailea resort but our favorites were:<br><br>

      <b>Oceanside BBQ Dinner Buffet</b><br>
         We decided to participate in their BBQ buffet on our first night there and boy we were not disapointed. There was plenty of food options 
         to choose from and they offered us a complimentary cocktail. During the BBQ they had fire dancers, yard games, and live music.<br> 
         <br>

         width="50%" height="50%"><br>
         <br>

      <b>Cabana Sunset Dinner</b><br>
         The resort offered several dinner options for special occasions. We had our anniversary dinner on one of their floating Cabanas. 
         We were able to watch the sunset together as we ate a Hawaiaan themed meal. The food was delicious and I was having a great time eating barefoot. 
         My husband surprised me by reading his vows. I thought that was really special. Later during our stay, resort management gifted us with a complimentary bottle of champagne. 
         We drank it our last night there on the balcony under the stars.<br> 
         <br>

         <br>

         <b>Pool Time</b><br>
         The resort has many pools which thankfully includes adult only ones. After our anniversary dinner, the meal attendent gifted us with an 
         all day reservation to one of their adult only cabanas. We rarely just lounge around and do nothing so that was a lovely 
         change of pace for us. We drank cocktails and my husband enjoyed some pool time.<br>
         <br>

         <br>

         We also spent a day at their Olakino Wellness Pool. Here, they played live music, offered free massages, 
         and served complimentary snacks and beverages.<br>

         <b>Ziplining</b><br>
         <p>
         When we vacation my husband tries to find a place to go ziplining. He enjoyed the 8 Line Ka'anapali Zipline Adventures on Maui ziplining. 
         He had a blast and returned without a sunburn which is goals!<br>

         <h2>The Dining</h2>
           <p>
            There were several restaurants and bars onsite but we gravited most towards The Humble Kitchin (yes it's really spelled that way) to enjoy
            their diverse breakfast buffet. There were areas to eat that allowed you to see the ocean. The server was very kind and gave us complimentary mimosas. 
            They also had birds that liked to perch on the hanging lights above some of the tables outside and watch for abandoned plates. 
            After that day we learned to avoid sitting under the hanging lights lol.<br> 
            <br>
